# Shodh--Policy-Optimization-for-Financial-Decision-Making
Imagine you are a Research Scientist at a fintech company. The company wants to improve its loan approval process. You have access to a historical dataset of all loans granted in the past, including applicant details and whether they ultimately defaulted or paid off the loan.
The goal is to develop an intelligent system that can decide whether to approve or deny a new loan application to maximize the company's financial return

#System Requirements

Python: 3.8 or higher (tested on 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
RAM: Minimum 8GB (16GB recommended for full dataset)
Storage: ~2GB for data and outputs
GPU: Optional but recommended for faster training (CUDA-compatible)
